 Once upon a time there was a man named Daryl. He was quite awkward and lanky,
but jubilant in nature. He lived in quite a small town, and he was bursting
with excitement. "I want to go on an adventure to see the world." After he had
worked for the locals and scrounged enough coin for him to be satisfied, he
set off for the west. Where he was going, he did not know.
 Daryl packed his bag with his clothes and other survival needs and booked a ticket 
for the next bus without even checking where it would take him to but just wanted to explore
the city where the bus finally stops. One of the other wishes that Daryl had was to travel through 
all possible means of transport like car, bus, airplane, ship, etc. Daryl was waiting for the bus 
in the bus stop. Daryl had been waiting for a long time now. He looked down at his watch, just to
check that he wasn't going crazy. The bus should have arrived a long time ago! Where was it? Daryl
looked around his immediate surroundings to ask for help, but he didn't see a single person. First
no bus and now everyone was missing?
Daryl sat on the ground and waited patiently for the bus to arrive. It started to get dark and he
slowly started to drift off into sleep. The next thing he knows, he is awoken by the sound of a bus
coming towards him. The bus stops there and waits for him to get on. Daryl could finally start his
adventure and see the word!
The bus seemed fine and clean, but there was nobody in it except for the driver. He awkwardly handed
the driver his ticket, and found a nice seat to sit on. Settling in, he notices the bus has a peculiar
buckle that seems to be too much for what a bus needs. "Is this bus designed to go to space or something?"
"You're my first customer to get it right the first time." Daryl's face went pale, and soon after the bus
takes off into the night sky. Daryl really was in for an out of world experience, and one he would tell his
grandchildren over and over again.
