 Once upon a time there was a man named Daryl. He was quite awkward and lanky,
but jubilant in nature. He lived in quite a small town, and he was bursting
with excitement. "I want to go on an adventure to see the world." After he had
worked for the locals and scrounged enough coin for him to be satisfied, he
set off for the west. Where he was going, he did not know.
 Daryl packed his bag with his clothes and other survival needs and booked a ticket 
for the next bus without even checking where it would take him to but just wanted to explore
the city where the bus finally stops. One of the other wishes that Daryl had was to travel through 
all possible means of transport like car, bus, airplane, ship, etc. Daryl was waiting for the bus 
in the bus stop.
