 Once upon a time there was a man named Daryl. He was quite awkward and lanky,
but jubilant in nature. He lived in quite a small town, and he was bursting
with excitement. "I want to go on an adventure to see the world." After he had
worked for the locals and scrounged enough coin for him to be satisfied, he
set off for the west. Where he was going, he did not know.
